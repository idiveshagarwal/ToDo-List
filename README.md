# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was initialized with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can use the following scripts:

### `npm start`

This script runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view it.

The page will reload if you make any edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

This script launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
For more information on running tests, see the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section.

### `npm run build`

This script builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include hashes.\
Your app is now ready to be deployed!

For more information on deployment, see the [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) section.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**

If you are not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, allowing you to have full control over them. All commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts, allowing you to customize them. From this point on, you are on your own.

You don't have to use `eject`. The provided features are suitable for small and medium deployments, and you are not obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool would not be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready.
